# Calculator

Overview
This is a Java-based calculator program that performs various operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, Fibonacci sequence generation, mean calculation, and variance calculation. The program is divided into three files:
Main.java
UserInput.java
Calculator.java
Purpose
The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, modularization, and separation of concerns. It uses objects to handle user input and calculations efficiently.

Features
Modular Design:
Code is split into separate files for clarity and maintainability.
Dynamic User Input:
Handles different types of inputs (single number, two numbers, arrays).
Robust Error Handling:
Prevents invalid input and displays meaningful error messages.
